# 🕸️ Neo4j Integration

## 🔍 What is Neo4j?

[Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/) is a graph database that stores data as **nodes** and **relationships** — ideal for representing highly connected information like file structures, route maps, or module dependencies.

---

## 🤝 Why Integrate Neo4j?

Awareness-Driven Development (ADD) promotes codebases that can **analyze and reflect on themselves**.

By connecting your project to Neo4j, you enable:
- 📊 Visualizing file/module relationships  
- 🧠 Querying architecture patterns  
- 💾 Persisting structural awareness over time  
- 🤖 Preparing rich context for LLMs or automated refactors

---

## 🌐 How to Connect Neo4j to Your Project

You can use your **own Neo4j instance**, either locally or via the cloud:

- [Neo4j Desktop](https://neo4j.com/download/)
- [Neo4j Aura (cloud)](https://neo4j.com/cloud/aura/)

> ⚠️ **Recommended**: Use a **private fork or repo** when enabling this integration, especially when syncing real project structure.

---

### 📦 Step 1 — Install the Neo4j Driver

Run the following command in your project root:

```bash
npm install neo4j-driver
```

---

### ⚙️ Step 2 — Set Up Your `.env`

Create a `.env` file in your project root and add the following:

```env
NEO4J_URI=neo4j+s://your-instance.databases.neo4j.io
NEO4J_USERNAME=neo4j
NEO4J_PASSWORD=your_password
NEO4J_DATABASE=neo4j
```

> ☑️ Ensure `.env` is listed in `.gitignore`  
> 🔒 Never commit database credentials to your repository

---

## 🧠 What Can You Do With It?

You can structure and persist code metadata such as:
- File structure
- Exports
- API route declarations
- Function relationships

Using Cypher (Neo4j's query language), you'll be able to:
- Inspect your architecture  
- Trace dependencies  
- Fuel smarter automation

---

## ⚠️ Security First

Neo4j can reflect your system’s structure — including sensitive paths, file names, and internal logic. Treat your graph as an internal-only intelligence layer.

- ✅ Keep credentials private  
- ✅ Use it on a private or forked repo  
- ✅ Review your sync logic to avoid leaking sensitive logic

---

## 🛠️ (Optional) Next Steps

- [🧪 Proposed] Add `/api/dev/graph-sync` to send safe files into Neo4j  
- [💡 LLM Vision] Build `/api/improve-code` to refactor via LLMs using graph context

---

Neo4j becomes the **long-term memory** of your system's architecture.  
Combine it with ADD, and your project gains both structure and insight.
