# ⚙️ Awareness-Driven Development (ADD)™

> “If the system doesn’t know what it is, it shouldn’t be deployed.”

## 🧠 What is ADD?

**Awareness-Driven Development (ADD)** is a programming paradigm where a system is built to understand itself before it evolves or deploys.

ADD prioritizes:
- Structure awareness
- Risk detection
- Transparent memory
- Graph-based introspection
- LLM-friendly design

> This paradigm empowers solo devs — the lone wolves — to build with confidence, safety, and vision.  
> _No more spaghetti. No more blind deployments._

## 🔁 The ADD Loop

1. **🧠 Awareness Scan**  
   `npm run brain` runs `backendAwarenessBrain.js` to analyze the backend.  
   [🐺 Approved]

2. **📄 Memory Generation**  
   Files saved to `jod/memory/`:  
   - `structure.json` → exports, routes, warnings  
   - `project.json` → package info  
   - `structure.txt` → ASCII map + warnings summary  
   [🐺 Approved]

3. **🔐 Security Check**  
   The brain detects:
   - `eval()`
   - `fs` sync writes
   - Hardcoded secrets  
   These appear in `structure.json`, console, and `.txt`.  
   [🐺 Approved]

4. **🧩 Graph Sync (Neo4j)**  
   Clean files can be synced to Neo4j, skipping unsafe ones.  
   Sync route is in development.  
   [🧪 Proposed]

5. **🤖 LLM Refactor (future)**  
   The system will request LLMs to suggest or apply code improvements  
   based on awareness context.

## 🧬 Guiding Principle

> A system that doesn’t know what it is  
> shouldn’t be trusted to evolve.

And a dev that builds **alone** shouldn’t build **blind**.  
ADD gives you sight. 🐺
