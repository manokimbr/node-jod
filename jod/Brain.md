# 🧠 backendAwarenessBrain.js

This script is part of the self-awareness system for the `node-jod` project.  
Its role is to give the **backend** the ability to understand its **own file structure**, **exports**, and **route declarations**.

---

## 🧩 What it does

When you run:

```bash
npm run brain
````

It performs a deep analysis of the `server/` folder and backend root:

1. **Scans all `.js` files** under `server/` and root
2. **Extracts:**

   * Named `export` statements (e.g. `export function`)
   * Hardcoded API route references (e.g. `/api/...`)
3. **Reads:**

   * Your `package.json` metadata (name, version, scripts, etc.)
4. **Generates:**

   * A clean `structure.json` with file-level data
   * A visual `structure.txt` (tree-style folder map)
   * A `project.json` summary (folders + package.json info)

---

## 📁 structure.json

Lists each file and what it defines:

```json
[
  {
    "file": "server/handlers/pingHandler.js",
    "exports": [
      "export function handlePing(req, res) {"
    ],
    "routes": []
  },
  {
    "file": "server/routes/router.js",
    "exports": [
      "export function router(req, res) {"
    ],
    "routes": [
      "else if (url === '/api/ping') {"
    ]
  },
  {
    "file": "server/utils/env.js",
    "exports": [
      "export function loadEnv() {"
    ],
    "routes": []
  },
  {
    "file": "index.js",
    "exports": [],
    "routes": []
  }
]
```

This allows tools (or even AI agents) to understand:

* Which files expose functionality
* Which ones register or map to APIs

---

## 🌳 structure.txt

For humans, we generate a tree view like this:

```
📁 ./
├── index.js
└── server
    ├── handlers
    │   └── pingHandler.js
    ├── routes
    │   └── router.js
    └── utils
        └── env.js
```

Quick and readable for CLI-based navigation.

## 📦 project.json

Contains your project's metadata and folder layout:

```json
{
  "folders": [
    "handlers",
    "routes",
    "utils"
  ],
  "package": {
    "name": "jod",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "description": "Exploring native Node.js 22 APIs",
    "author": "Kim Souza",
    "scripts": {
      "start": "node index.js",
      "dev": "NODE_ENV=development node index.js",
      "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
      "brain": "node jod/backendAwarenessBrain.js"
    },
    "type": "module"
  }
}
```

## 🧠 Why it matters

The backend brain script helps your server:

* **Explain itself** to contributors, tools or agents
* Track route and export definitions as the app evolves
* Serve as a base for codegen, testing, or analysis pipelines

---

> Build APIs that can describe themselves.
> Let your backend see — and one day fix — its own mind.
